## Tweet Processing and Upload

The tweets were collected on three bases: 1. Keyword, 2. Location 3. Date range. Only tweets in English were collected for this purpose
Keyword: 15 trending keywords related to COVID-19.
Location: Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata.
Date Range: Three phases â€” Pre-lockdown, Lockdown, Unlock.
The GetOldTweets3 python library was used to collect the tweets based on the above three criteria. To preprocess the data, NLTK packages were used.
To save you from the hassle, I have uploaded the dataset in my Github repo. The techniques used for data collection and preprocessing is explained in the readme file.
All dataset contains three features: tweet text, location, phase.
